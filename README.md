Luxury Hotel Performance Dashboard Project
Project Overview
AtliQ Grands, a prominent player in the luxury and business hotel industry, is experiencing a decline in market share and revenue. This project aims to leverage Power BI to develop an interactive Luxury Hotel Performance Dashboard that provides actionable insights. By analyzing key performance metrics, the dashboard will empower stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, ultimately helping AtliQ Grands regain its competitive edge in the luxury hotel sector.

Objectives:-
The primary objectives of this project are to:

Incorporate key metrics such as RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), Avg. Rating, Occupancy %, and DSRN (Daily Sales Revenue per Night).
Provide stakeholders with data-driven insights to inform strategic decisions.
Increase revenue and regain market share in the luxury hotel category.
Data Sources:-
The project utilizes data from various sources within the hospitality industry, including:

Historical Hotel Performance Data: Booking records, room rates, and occupancy levels.
Market Trends: Industry benchmarks and competitive analysis.
Customer Feedback: Customer ratings, reviews, and satisfaction scores.
Key Metrics and Definitions
RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room): Measures the average revenue generated per available room.
ADR (Average Daily Rate): The average rate paid for rooms sold.
Avg. Rating: Average customer rating for the hotel.
Occupancy %: Percentage of available rooms that are occupied.
DSRN (Daily Sales Revenue per Night): Revenue generated per night from all occupied rooms.
Dashboard Features:-
The Luxury Hotel Performance Dashboard offers the following features to facilitate data analysis and decision-making:

Interactive Visuals: Charts, graphs, and tables that allow stakeholders to easily understand key performance indicators.
Customizable Filters: Options to filter data by date, property, room type, and other key factors.
